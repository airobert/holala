To generate the article files. You need to uncommend the following lines in 
hol.ml:

(* start_logging();; *)

(* stop_logging();; *)

You will then get the article files in the directory ./opentheory/articles/

HOLALA is portable with HOLIDE2x (rather than Holide2).

Below is a list of major changes compared with (OpentThoery's) HOL Light: 

0) the kernel (fusion.ml) takes the universal quantifier and implication 
	as primitive symbols.

1) the kernel takes a new proof logging (proof recording) method.

2) some inference rules have been re-proved in bool.ml

3) we erased the proof of law of excluded midle and take it as an axiom 
	(as in class.ml). Following that, FORALL_DEF and IMP_DEF were re-proven.

4) the proof exporting function now deals with the extended inference rules as 
	in opentheory/export.ml.
