To generate the article files. You need to uncommend the following lines in 
hol.ml:

(* start_logging();; *)

(* stop_logging();; *)

You will then get the article files in the directory ./opentheory/articles/

HOLALA is portable with HOLIDE2x (rather than Holide2).

Below is a list of major changes compared with (OpentThoery's) HOL Light: 

0) the kernel (fusion.ml) files has an extended kernel with the universal 
	quantifier and implication as primitive symbol.

1) the kernel takes a new proof logging (proof recording) method.

2) some inference rules have been re-proved in bool.ml

3) we erase the proof of law of excluded midle and take it as an axiom 
	as in class.ml. Following that, FORALL_DEF and IMP_DEF were re-proven.

4) proof exporting function now deals with extended inference rules as in 
	opentheory/export.ml.
